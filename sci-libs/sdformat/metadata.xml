SDF is an XML file format that describes environments, objects, and robots
in a manner suitable for robotic applications. SDF is capable of representing
and describing different physic engines, lighting properties, terrain, static
or dynamic objects, and articulated robots with various sensors, and acutators.
The format of SDF is also described by XML, which facilitates updates and
allows conversion from previous versions. A parser is also contained within
this package that reads SDF files and returns a C++ interface.
