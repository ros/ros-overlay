    This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI
		(reconfigure_gui), and provides the way to view and edit the parameters
		that are accessible via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/>
		<br/>
		(12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated
		with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might
		become handled.
		However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent
		on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched
		to nodes.
