The COLLADA Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) that provides a C++ object representation of a COLLADA XML instance document.

This project is a library for loading and saving COLLADA documents that can contain 2D, 3D, physics and other types of content. It allows developers to create applications that can exchange COLLADA documents with commercial content creation tools such as Maya, Max or Softimage.
