    This project is a SimTK toolset providing general multibody dynamics capability,
    that is, the ability to solve Newton's 2nd law F=ma in any set of generalized coordinates
    subject to arbitrary constraints. (That's Isaac himself in the oval.) Simbody is provided
    as an open source, object-oriented C++ API and delivers high-performance, accuracy-controlled
    science/engineering-quality results.
