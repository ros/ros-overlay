  <longdescription>
    Math toolkit for Yujin open control system. This package is intended to contain common use functions,
    mostly for simple mathematics but also for tf-related conversions.
    By no means it pretends to be an efficient and robust, widely used math library, but a play ground where
    to put common code that is typically repeated in many robot control programs.
