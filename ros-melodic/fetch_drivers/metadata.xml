    The public fetch_drivers package is a binary only release.

    fetch_drivers contains both the drivers and firmware for the fetch and freight research robots.
    There should be no reason to use these drivers unless you're running on a fetch or a freight research robot.
    This package, is a cmake/make only package which installs the binaries for the drivers and firmware.
