      ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 5400 (and variants).
    </p>
    <p>
      This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files
      for ABB IRB 5400 manipulators. This currently includes the base model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in
      the ABB data sheets.  All URDFs / XACROs are based on the
      default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie:
      no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or
      other options).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included
      in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular
      robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
    </p>
