    The PR2 is equipped with a texture projector that can be used to
    project a texture onto featureless surfaces, allowing their
    three-dimensional structure to be determined using stereoscopy. The
    projector operates in a pulsed mode, producing brief (2ms) pulses of
    light. Cameras that want to see the texture must expose during the
    projector pulse; other cameras should be expose while the projector is
    off.
    </p>

    <p>
      This package contains the pr2_projector_synchronizer node. Based on its dynamically reconfigurable parameters, this node controls the projector pulsing, and sets up triggering of the WGE100 cameras.
