    A multiplexer for command velocity inputs. Arbitrates incoming cmd_vel messages from several topics,
     allowing one topic at a time to command the robot, based on priorities. It also deallocates current
     allowed topic if no messages are received after a configured timeout. All topics, together with their
     priority and timeout are configured through a YAML file, that can be reload at runtime.
