    The mbf_costmap_nav package contains the costmap navigation server implementation of Move Base Flex (MBF). The costmap navigation server is bound to the <a href="wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d">costmap_2d</a> representation. It provides the Actions for planning, controlling and recovering. At the time of start MBF loads all defined plugins. Therefor, it loads all plugins which are defined in the lists *planners*, *controllers* and *recovery_behaviors*. Each list holds a pair of a *name* and a *type*. The *type* defines which kind of plugin to load. The *name* defines under which name the plugin should be callable by the actions. 

        Additionally the mbf_costmap_nav package comes with a wrapper for the old navigation stack and the plugins which inherits from the <a href="wiki.ros.org/nav_core">nav_core</a> base classes. Preferably it tries to load plugins for the new API. However, plugins could even support both <a href="wiki.ros.org/move_base">move_base</a> and <a href="wiki.ros.org/move_base_flex">move_base_flex</a> by inheriting both base class interfaces located in the <a href="wiki.ros.org/nav_core">nav_core</a> package and in the <a href="mbf_costmap_core">mbf_costmap_core</a> package.
