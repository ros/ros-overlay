    This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to
    <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/tf">tf</a>. Once the state gets published, it is
    available to all components in the system that also use <tt>tf</tt>.
    The package takes the joint angles of the robot as input
    and publishes the 3D poses of the robot links, using a kinematic
    tree model of the robot. The package can both be used as a library
    and as a ROS node.  This package has been well tested and the code
    is stable. No major changes are planned in the near future.
