    The pr2_gripper_sensor_action package provides an action interface for talking to the pr2_gripper_sensor_controller real-time controller.

  It provides several different actions for getting high-level sensor information from the PR2 palm-mounted accelerometers, fingertip pressure arrays, and gripper motor/encoder, as well as several sensor-based gripper control actions that respond with low-latency in real-time.
