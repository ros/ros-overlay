    <p>Packages in the denso suite provide controller functionality for Denso's industrial manipulators. </p>
   <p><a href="http://goo.gl/kL0vnf">ORiN</a> (Open Robot interface for the Network) is a unified network interface for industrial robot applications and has been stably utilized in Denso's manipulators for years. Controllers in this package suite uses b-CAP, UDP-based control protocol defined in ORiN. It also has mechanism to detect faulty commands. Using b-CAP, ROS communicates to the embedded controller computer that has been achieving industry-proven reliability. The computer also has mechanism to detect faulty commands. That said as a whole the system maintains the same level of safeness with their commercial product setting.</p>
   <p>Also, as a genuine ROS package, it enables robot application developers to access full ROS features. MoveIt! configuration package is also included for some of Denso's robots.</p>
   <p>Core functionality </p>
